Most Basic Windows SDK Style Program And Tutorial

It really only takes about 30 or so lines of code to create the simplest Window Procedure possible, register a custom class,
create a window, and drop into a message pump.  I've always thought that breaking things down to the barest minimum that
still shows the essentials of some concept is the way to go.  This program does just that.

The interested reader should be able to import this project into Visual Studio, but I'd recommend the reader attempt to learn
command line compiling by reading my tutorial on that.  Further, one could learn to use my custom C Runtime in lieu of 
Microsoft's C Runtime to create a statically linked 'stand alone' executable 20 to 25 times smaller than that produced by
linking with Microsoft's runtime.  See my TCLib repository for details on that.
